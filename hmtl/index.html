   <h1>Welcome to my first practical class</h1>
   <p>Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself<br> 
questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same 
question of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much <br>
easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply 
reject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what <br>
he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced 
me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a<br> 
process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in 
the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view</p>
